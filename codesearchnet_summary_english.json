It can also optionally add the same suffix to the `id` of all its child elements.\n\n2. **Parameters**:\n   - `idsuffix`: This is the text you want to append to the `id`.\n   - `recursive` (optional, defaults to `True`): If set to `True`, the function will also apply the suffix to the `id` of all child elements. If `False`, only the current element\u2019s `id` is updated.\n\n3. **How it works**:\n   - If the element has an `id`, the function appends the `idsuffix` to it.\n   - If `recursive` is `True`, it loops through all child elements and tries to call `addidsuffix` on each of them, repeating the process for their `id`s.\n   - If an error occurs while trying to add the suffix to a child element, it\u2019s ignored (using `try` and `except`).\n\n4. **Use case**: This function is typically used when you want to ensure that copied or duplicated elements have unique IDs by appending a suffix. It\u2019s often called automatically by another method (like `copy`), so you usually don\u2019t need to call it directly.\n\nIn short, it\u2019s a utility function to modify IDs by adding a suffix, with the option to apply this change to all child elements as well."

This ensures that if the item has its own child elements, their parent relationships are also corrected.\n\n3. **When it\u2019s used**: The function is typically called automatically (implicitly) when copying elements, so you usually don\u2019t need to call it directly.

If any child is an instance of `AbstractElement`, it calls the `setdoc` function on that child, passing the new document (`newdoc`) to ensure all nested elements are updated as well.\n\n3. **In simpler terms**: It swaps out the current document for a new one, makes sure the object is properly registered in the new document's index, and ensures all child elements are also updated to use the new document.\n\nThis function is mostly used internally to manage document associations when copying or moving elements between documents."

This is like checking if the element fits into a predefined category or meets certain criteria.\n   - If the set definition (`self.set`) isn\u2019t found (`KeyError`), it raises an error unless the document allows \"adhoc sets\" (`self.doc.allowadhocsets`).\n\n4. **Error Handling**:\n   - If the validation fails (e.g., the element doesn\u2019t meet the criteria), it raises a `DeepValidationError` with a detailed error message. The message includes:\n     - The original error.\n     - The set being validated.\n     - The element\u2019s tag (`self.XMLTAG`).\n     - Optionally, the element\u2019s ID (`self.id`) if it exists.\n\n5. **Example**:\n   Imagine you\u2019re checking if a book belongs to a specific genre in a library catalog. This function would ensure the book\u2019s genre matches the rules for that genre, and if not, it would tell you exactly what went wrong.\n\nIn short, this function ensures an element is valid according to specific rules and provides detailed feedback if it\u2019s not."

FoLiA stands for Format for Linguistic Annotation, which is used for representing linguistic annotations in a structured way.\n\nHere\u2019s a breakdown of what the function does in simple terms:\n\n1. **Initialization**: It prepares to create an XML element using a specific namespace (NSFOLIA) for FoLiA and another for XML.\n\n2. **Attribute Handling**: It checks and sets various attributes for the XML element based on the properties of the FoLiA element. These attributes include things like IDs, classes, annotators, confidence levels, dates, and more. It ensures these attributes are only added if they are relevant and not already set by the caller.\n\n3. **Feature Handling**: It looks for specific features (like annotations or metadata) that should be represented as attributes in the XML. If found, it adds them to the XML element and skips adding them as separate child elements.\n\n4. **Child Element Handling**: If the FoLiA element has child elements (like text content or other annotations), it processes them. It ensures text elements are ordered correctly (with the 'current' class first) and appends them to the XML element. It also handles cases where child elements should be skipped or added as text content.\n\n5. **Extra Elements**: If additional elements are provided, they are appended to the XML element either as text or as child elements.\n\n6. **Return Value**: Finally, the function returns the constructed XML element, ready to be used or serialized further.\n\nIn essence, this function takes a FoLiA element, processes its attributes and child elements, and converts it into a well-structured XML representation, ensuring all relevant details are included and formatted correctly."

This dictionary is structured in a way that makes it easy to later convert into JSON (JavaScript Object Notation), which is a common format for sharing data.\n\nHere\u2019s what it does step by step:\n\n1. **Initialization**: It starts by creating an empty dictionary called `jsonnode`, which will hold all the information about the FoLiA element.\n\n2. **Basic Information**: It adds some basic details about the FoLiA element to `jsonnode`, such as its type (`self.XMLTAG`), ID (`self.id`), set (`self.set`), class (`self.cls`), annotator (`self.annotator`), annotator type (`self.annotatortype`), confidence (`self.confidence`), n (`self.n`), auth (`self.auth`), and datetime (`self.datetime`). If any of these attributes are not set, they are skipped.\n\n3. **Recursive Processing (if `recurse` is True)**:\n   - It initializes a list called `children` to hold any child elements.\n   - If the FoLiA element contains text (`self.TEXTCONTAINER`), it adds the text to `jsonnode` under the key `'text'`.\n   - If the FoLiA element contains phonetic information (`self.PHONCONTAINER`), it adds the phonetic data to `jsonnode` under the key `'phon'`.\n   - It then iterates over each child element:\n     - If the child is a string and the element is a text container, it directly adds the string to the `children` list.\n     - If the child is not a string and the element is not a phonetic container, it checks if the child should be ignored based on an `ignorelist`. If not ignored, it recursively calls the `json` function on the child and adds the resulting dictionary to the `children` list.\n\n4. **Additional Attributes**: If there are any additional attributes specified in the `attribs` parameter, it adds them to `jsonnode`.\n\n5. **Return**: Finally, it returns the `jsonnode` dictionary, which now contains all the serialized information about the FoLiA element and its children.\n\nIn essence, this function takes a complex FoLiA structure and flattens it into a dictionary format that can be easily converted to JSON, making it suitable for storage or transmission."

    "summary": "Sure! Let\u2019s break down what this Python function does in simple terms:\n\n### **Purpose of the Function:**\nThe `select` function is used to find and return specific child elements within a structure (like a tree or hierarchy) based on certain criteria. These elements are instances of a particular class (e.g., `AbstractElement` or its subclasses).\n\n### **Key Features:**\n1. **Filtering by Class:**\n   - It looks for elements that belong to a specific class (`Class`). For example, if you specify `folia.Sense`, it will only return elements of that type.\n\n2. **Filtering by Set:**\n   - You can further narrow down the results by specifying a `set` (e.g., `'cornetto'`). Only elements belonging to that set will be returned. If no set is specified (`None`), it returns all matching elements regardless of their set.\n\n3. **Recursive Search:**\n   - By default (`recursive=True`), the function searches not just the immediate children but also their children, and so on, down the hierarchy. If `recursive=False`, it only checks the direct children.\n\n4. **Ignoring Certain Elements:**\n   - The `ignore` parameter lets you skip certain types of elements. If `ignore=True`, it skips non-authoritative elements (like `Alternative`, `Suggestion`, etc.). If `ignore` is a list, it skips elements matching any class in that list.\n\n5. **Internal Recursion:**\n   - The `node` parameter is used internally to keep track of the current position in the hierarchy during recursive searches.\n\n### **What It Returns:**\nThe function uses `yield` to generate a sequence of matching elements one by one. This means it doesn\u2019t return a single list but instead produces elements as needed, which is efficient for large datasets.\n\n### **Example Use Case:**\n```python\nfor sense in text.select(folia.Sense, 'cornetto', True, [folia.Original, folia.Suggestion, folia.Alternative]):\n    # Do something with each `sense` element\n```\nHere, it\u2019s finding all `folia.Sense` elements in the `cornetto` set, skipping `Original`, `Suggestion`, and `Alternative` elements, and processing each `sense` one by one.\n\n### **In a Nutshell:**\nThis function helps you search through a hierarchical structure of elements, filter them by class and set, skip unwanted types, and explore recursively if needed. It\u2019s a powerful tool for extracting specific data from complex structures."

    "summary": "Sure! Let me break down what this function does in simple terms:\n\nThe `previous` function is designed to find and return the **previous element** in a sequence, but only if it meets certain conditions. Here\u2019s what it checks:\n\n1. **Type of Element**: It looks for an element that belongs to a specific type (or class). You can specify this type using the `Class` argument. If you set `Class=True`, it will look for an element of the same type as the current one. If you set `Class=None`, it won\u2019t care about the type at all.\n\n2. **Scope Boundary**: It ensures that the search for the previous element doesn\u2019t cross certain boundaries. You can define these boundaries using the `scope` argument. If you set `scope=True`, it will use a default list of boundaries (like Sentence, Paragraph, Division, etc.). If you set `scope=None`, it won\u2019t limit the search by any boundaries.\n\n3. **Non-Authoritative Elements**: It ignores certain types of elements that are considered \"non-authoritative,\" meaning they\u2019re not returned even if they match the other criteria.\n\nIf it finds a previous element that meets all these conditions, it returns that element. If no such element is found, it returns `None`.\n\nIn essence, this function helps you navigate backward in a sequence of elements while respecting specific rules about what types of elements are allowed and where the search can go."

    "summary": "Sure! Let\u2019s break down what this function does in simple terms:\n\n1. **Purpose**: The `leftcontext` function retrieves the elements that come **before** a given element (like words in a sentence or paragraphs in a document) and returns them as a list. This is called the \"left context\" because it looks to the left (or before) the current element.\n\n2. **Inputs**:\n   - `size`: The number of elements you want to retrieve from the left.\n   - `placeholder`: An optional value to fill in if there aren't enough elements to reach the requested `size`.\n   - `scope`: An optional parameter to limit the search to specific boundaries (like within the same sentence or paragraph).\n\n3. **How it works**:\n   - If `size` is 0, it immediately returns an empty list (for efficiency).\n   - It starts at the current element (`self`) and moves backward (`previous`) to collect elements until it has gathered `size` elements or reaches the beginning.\n   - If `scope` is set, it only looks within that boundary (e.g., within the same sentence).\n   - If there aren't enough elements to reach `size`, it fills the remaining spots with the `placeholder` value (if provided).\n   - Finally, it reverses the list (since it collected elements in reverse order) and returns it.\n\n4. **Example**:\n   - If the current element is the word \"cat\" in a sentence \"The dog chased the cat,\" and you call `leftcontext(2)`, it would return `['chased', 'dog']`.\n   - If you call `leftcontext(3, placeholder='?')` but there are only two words before \"cat,\" it would return `['chased', 'dog', '?']`.\n\nIn short, this function helps you look backward from a specific point and gather a specified number of elements, filling in gaps if needed."

This is useful for getting the \"right context\" or the elements that follow something in a sequence (like words in a sentence or paragraphs in a document).\n\n2. **Inputs**:\n   - `size`: The number of elements you want to retrieve from the right context.\n   - `placeholder`: An optional value to fill in if there aren\u2019t enough elements to meet the `size` requirement.\n   - `scope`: An optional parameter to limit the search to specific boundaries (like staying within the same sentence or paragraph).\n\n3. **How it works**:\n   - It starts with the current element (`self`) and moves forward (to the \"next\" element) until it collects the desired number of elements (`size`).\n   - If it runs out of elements before reaching `size`, it stops.\n   - If a `placeholder` is provided and there aren\u2019t enough elements, it fills the remaining spots with the `placeholder`.\n   - If `scope` is set, it respects those boundaries (e.g., doesn\u2019t cross into the next sentence or paragraph).\n\n4. **Output**: The function returns a list of elements from the right context, padded with placeholders if necessary.\n\n**Example**:\nImagine you\u2019re looking at the word \"cat\" in a sentence and want the next 3 words. If the sentence is \"The cat sat on the mat,\" and you ask for `size=3`, the function returns `[\"sat\", \"on\", \"the\"]`. If the sentence only had 2 words left, and you provided a `placeholder` like `\"_\"`, it would return `[\"sat\", \"on\", \"_\"]`.\n\nIn short, it\u2019s a way to grab the elements that come after something, with options to handle edge cases like running out of elements or staying within specific boundaries."

RelaxNG is a language used to describe the structure of XML documents, ensuring they follow specific rules.\n\nHere\u2019s what the function does step by step:\n\n1. **Setup**: It prepares to create an XML structure using RelaxNG, defining namespaces (like prefixes for URLs) to organize the schema.\n\n2. **Documentation**: If the class has a description (docstring), it adds that as documentation in the schema.\n\n3. **Attributes Handling**: It checks for required or optional attributes (like `id`, `class`, `annotator`, etc.) in the class and adds them to the schema. For example:\n   - If `id` is required, it ensures the schema includes an `id` attribute of type `ID`.\n   - If `class` is optional, it allows but doesn\u2019t require a `class` attribute.\n\n4. **Extra Attributes/Elements**: If additional attributes or elements are provided, they\u2019re added to the schema.\n\n5. **Text Content**: If the class is a text or phonetics container, it allows text content in the schema.\n\n6. **Child Elements**: If the class can contain other elements (defined in `ACCEPTED_DATA`), it adds those to the schema. For example, if the class can contain `item` elements, it allows zero or more of those.\n\n7. **Final Schema Construction**: It combines all the attributes and elements into a RelaxNG schema definition, ensuring the XML follows the specified rules.\n\n8. **Return**: The function returns the RelaxNG schema as an XML element (not a string), ready to be used for validating XML documents.\n\nIn essence, this function automates the creation of a schema that defines how XML elements of a specific class should be structured, including their attributes, child elements, and text content."

    "summary": "Sure! Let me break down what this function does in simple terms:\n\n### **Function Name:** `parsexml`\n\n### **Purpose:**\nThis function takes an XML element (like a piece of data in a structured format) and turns it into an instance of a specific class (like creating an object in Python based on the XML data).\n\n### **Key Steps:**\n\n1. **Input Validation:**\n   - It checks if the `Class` provided is a subclass of `AbstractElement`, ensuring it\u2019s the right type of class to work with.\n\n2. **Preprocessing (Optional):**\n   - If there\u2019s a `preparsexmlcallback` function defined in the `doc` (document), it runs that function on the XML `node`. If the callback returns `None`, the function stops and returns `None`. If the callback returns an `AbstractElement`, it returns that directly.\n\n3. **Processing XML Node:**\n   - It checks if the XML `node` belongs to a specific namespace (`NSDCOI`).\n   - It collects text content from the node if the class is designed to handle text (`Class.TEXTCONTAINER` or `Class.PHONCONTAINER`).\n\n4. **Handling Child Nodes:**\n   - It loops through all child nodes (`subnode`) of the current XML node.\n   - If a child node is a comment, it skips it but collects any text that follows the comment.\n   - If a child node belongs to the FoLiA namespace (`NSFOLIA`), it recursively processes that child node using the same `parsexml` function.\n   - If a child node belongs to the DCOI namespace (`NSDCOI`), it handles it specially, depending on the type of class being created (e.g., `Text`, `Word`, `Gap`, etc.).\n   - If a child node doesn\u2019t belong to any recognized namespace, it logs a debug message and ignores it.\n\n5. **Handling Attributes:**\n   - It processes the attributes of the XML node (like `id`, `pos`, `lemma`, etc.).\n   - It renames or transforms certain attributes based on their namespace or type (e.g., `XMLid` becomes `id`, DCOI attributes are renamed for compatibility).\n   - Special handling is done for DCOI-specific attributes like `pos`, `lemma`, `correction`, etc., which are used to add annotations to the resulting object.\n\n6. **Creating the Instance:**\n   - It creates an instance of the `Class` using the collected arguments (`args`) and keyword arguments (`kwargs`).\n\n7. **Postprocessing (Optional):**\n   - If there\u2019s a `parsexmlcallback` function defined in the `doc`, it runs that function on the newly created instance. If the callback returns `None`, the function stops and returns `None`. If the callback returns an `AbstractElement`, it returns that directly.\n\n8. **Return the Instance:**\n   - Finally, it returns the created instance of the class.\n\n### **In a Nutshell:**\nThis function takes an XML element, processes its structure and attributes, and converts it into a Python object of a specific class. It handles special cases like namespaces, text content, and callbacks, ensuring the XML data is accurately represented as a Python object."

If not, it raises an error saying it expected an `AbstractElement` but got something else.\n\n3. **Detach the child from its parent**:  \n   - If the `child` is indeed part of the current parent (`child.parent == self`), it sets the child's parent to `None`, effectively detaching it.\n\n4. **Remove the child from the data**:  \n   - It removes the `child` from the parent's internal data storage (`self.data.remove(child)`).\n\n5. **Clean up the index (if applicable)**:  \n   - If the `child` has an `id`, and there\u2019s a document (`self.doc`) with an index, and that `id` exists in the index, it deletes the `id` from the index (`del self.doc.index[child.id]`).\n\n**In summary**:  \nThis function removes a child element from its parent, ensures it\u2019s no longer connected, and cleans up any associated references (like an index) if they exist.

If not, it returns `None`.\n\n2. **How it works**:\n   - It starts by looking at the parent of the current element (`self.parent`).\n   - It then keeps moving up the hierarchy (from child to parent) until it either:\n     - Finds a `Correction` element, in which case it returns that element.\n     - Encounters an `AbstractStructureElement`, which signals it should stop searching further.\n     - Reaches the top of the hierarchy (where `e` becomes `None`), in which case it returns `None`.\n\n3. **In simpler terms**: It\u2019s like climbing up a family tree to see if any ancestor is a \"correction.\" If it finds one, it points to that ancestor; if not, it says, \"No correction found.\"\n\nSo, the function essentially answers the question: **\"Is this element part of a correction, and if so, which correction is it part of?\"**"

    "summary": "Sure! Let\u2019s break down what this function does in simple terms:\n\n### **Purpose of the Function:**\nThe `correct` function is used to apply or manage corrections to a document. It handles tasks like adding new content, replacing existing content, or suggesting changes, while keeping track of the original and modified versions.\n\n### **Key Steps Explained:**\n\n1. **Cleanup and Preparation:**\n   - It removes unnecessary or already-handled arguments (like `insertindex_offset`).\n   - If `confidence` is `None`, it\u2019s removed since it\u2019s not needed.\n   - If `reuse` is provided, it tries to reuse an existing correction instead of creating a new one.\n\n2. **Handling Reused Corrections:**\n   - If `reuse` is specified, it checks if it\u2019s a valid correction or an index pointing to one.\n   - If the correction only has suggestions (no new or original content), it prepares to turn it into a full correction.\n\n3. **Managing Content:**\n   - If `new` content is provided, it replaces or adds it, ensuring no conflicts with existing content.\n   - If `original` content is provided, it saves the original version before making changes.\n   - If `current` content is provided, it replaces the current version with the new one.\n\n4. **Automatic Inference:**\n   - If no `original` content is specified but `new` content is added, it tries to automatically find what should be replaced.\n\n5. **Suggestions:**\n   - If `suggestion` or `suggestions` are provided, it adds them to the correction.\n\n6. **Finalizing the Correction:**\n   - If reusing a correction, it updates metadata like `annotator`, `annotatortype`, or `confidence`.\n   - The correction is added to the document at the specified index or appended if no index is given.\n\n### **In a Nutshell:**\nThis function is a versatile tool for managing corrections in a document. It can create new corrections, reuse existing ones, handle replacements, additions, and suggestions, and ensure everything is properly tracked and organized. It\u2019s designed to be flexible, allowing for both manual and automatic handling of changes."

If you provide an integer, it will return only the sentence at that specific position (starting from 0).\n\n3. **How it works**:\n   - If `index` is not provided (`None`), the function uses `self.select` to find all `Sentence` elements under the current element (recursively) and returns them as a generator. A generator is like a list, but it doesn\u2019t store all items in memory at once, making it more efficient for large datasets.\n   - If `index` is provided, the function does the following:\n     - If the index is negative, it converts it to a positive index by counting the total number of sentences and adding the negative index. For example, `-1` would refer to the last sentence.\n     - It then iterates through all sentences using `self.select` and returns the sentence at the specified index.\n     - If the index is out of range (e.g., asking for the 5th sentence when there are only 3), it raises an `IndexError` to let you know the index is invalid.\n\n4. **Example**:\n   - If you call `sentences()` without an index, it might return something like: `[Sentence1, Sentence2, Sentence3]`.\n   - If you call `sentences(1)`, it will return `Sentence2` (assuming there are at least two sentences).\n\nIn short, this function is a flexible way to either get all sentences or a specific sentence from a given element, depending on what you need."

If you don\u2019t specify a set, it gives you all morphemes.\n3. **How It Works**:\n   - It looks through different **layers** of linguistic analysis (like morphology layers, which deal with word structure).\n   - For each layer, it checks for morphemes.\n   - If a morpheme matches the set you specified (or any morpheme if no set is specified), it hands it to you one by one.\n4. **Note**: If you only want a specific morpheme by its position (index), you should use a different function called `morpheme()` instead.\n\nIn short, this function is like a morpheme delivery system\u2014it gives you all the morphemes you ask for, either from a specific group or from everything available."

If it can\u2019t find it (because of a `KeyError`), it just adds the `WordReference` itself to the `targets` list.\n   - If the item is an `AbstractSpanAnnotation` and the `recurse` flag is `True`, it calls itself (recursively) to dig deeper into that item and collect more targets.\n   - If the item is a `Correction` and it has an author (`c.auth`), it looks inside the correction for specific child items (`AbstractCorrectionChild`). If those child items also have an author (`e.auth`), it goes even deeper into those child items to find `AbstractSpanAnnotation` objects and recursively collects targets from them.\n\n3. **Collects targets**: The main goal is to gather all relevant items (like words, morphemes, or resolved references) into the `targets` list.\n\nIn short, this function is like a collector that gathers specific linguistic elements (words, morphemes, etc.) from a complex structure, resolving references when possible and digging deeper if needed."

This is treated as a correction, meaning the original word remains, but the new word is inserted before it.\n\n2. **Inputs**:\n   - `newword`: The word (or list/tuple of words) you want to insert.\n   - `nextword`: The existing word in the sentence that the new word should be inserted before.\n   - `**kwargs`: Additional optional arguments (like `insertindex` and `nooriginal`) that control how the insertion happens.\n\n3. **Checks**:\n   - It verifies that `nextword` is a valid word in the sentence and is of the correct type (`Word`).\n   - It ensures `newword` is either a single `Word` or a list/tuple of `Word` instances. If not, it raises an error.\n\n4. **Insertion Logic**:\n   - If `nextword` is provided, it finds the position of `nextword` in the sentence and inserts `newword` just before it.\n   - If `nextword` is not provided, it inserts `newword` at the beginning of the sentence.\n   - It sets `nooriginal` to `True`, meaning the original word is not replaced but remains in the sentence.\n\n5. **Execution**:\n   - If `newword` is a list or tuple, it uses the `correctwords` method to insert all the words in the list before `nextword`.\n   - If `newword` is a single word, it inserts just that word.\n\nIn essence, this function is a tool for **adding words as corrections** in a sentence, ensuring they appear just before a specified existing word while keeping the original sentence structure intact."

    "docstring": "Resolve a variable sized pattern to all patterns of a certain fixed size",
    "summary": "Sure! Let's break down what this function does in simple terms:\n\n1. **Purpose**: The function `resolve` takes a pattern that can vary in size (because it contains wildcards, represented by `*`) and transforms it into a fixed-size pattern based on a given distribution.\n\n2. **Checks**:\n   - It first checks if the pattern actually has variable size (i.e., contains wildcards). If not, it raises an error because this function is only meant for patterns with wildcards.\n   - It then counts how many wildcards (`*`) are in the pattern.\n\n3. **Distribution**:\n   - The `distribution` parameter is a list that specifies how many times each wildcard should be replaced. For example, if there are two wildcards and `distribution` is `[2, 3]`, the first wildcard will be replaced twice, and the second wildcard will be replaced three times.\n\n4. **Transformation**:\n   - The function iterates through the pattern. Whenever it encounters a wildcard (`*`), it replaces it with a number of `True` values based on the corresponding value in the `distribution` list.\n   - Non-wildcard characters are simply added to the new sequence as they are.\n\n5. **Output**:\n   - The function creates a new pattern (`Pattern`) using the transformed sequence and some additional metadata (like `matchannotation`, `matchannotationset`, and `casesensitive`).\n   - It yields this new pattern, meaning it can generate multiple patterns if called in a loop.\n\nIn essence, this function takes a flexible pattern with wildcards and expands it into specific, fixed-size patterns based on the provided distribution."

Let me break down what this function does in simple terms:\n\n1. **Purpose**: The function `load` is designed to load and process a specific type of file, called a **FoLiA XML file**. FoLiA stands for \"Format for Linguistic Annotation,\" which is a way to store linguistic data in a structured format using XML.\n\n2. **Input**: It takes one argument, `filename`, which is the name (or path) of the FoLiA XML file you want to load.\n\n3. **Steps**:\n   - **Load the XML file**: The function uses a helper function called `xmltreefromfile` to read the contents of the file and convert it into an XML tree structure. This tree represents the hierarchical organization of the data in the XML file.\n   - **Parse the XML**: After loading the file, it calls another function, `parsexml`, to process the root element of the XML tree. This step likely extracts or organizes the data in a way that the program can use later.\n   - **Clean up**: If the program is not in a specific mode called `Mode.XPATH`, it discards the XML tree (`self.tree = None`). This is done because the tree is no longer needed after parsing, and keeping it in memory would waste resources.\n\n4. **Summary**: In essence, this function reads a FoLiA XML file, processes its contents, and prepares the data for further use in the program. It also cleans up unnecessary data to save memory."

    "summary": "Sure! Let me break it down in simple terms:\n\nThis function, called `items`, is part of a larger program (likely a class, since it uses `self`). Its job is to gather **all the items** from a document and return them in a **single, flat list**. Here\u2019s how it works step by step:\n\n1. **Starts with an empty list (`l = []`)**: It creates a blank list to store the items it finds.\n2. **Looks through the document's data**: It goes through each element (`e`) in the document's data (`self.data`).\n3. **Collects items from each element**: For each element, it uses the `e.items()` method to get a list of items from that element and adds them to the list `l` using `+=`.\n4. **Returns the final list**: Once it\u2019s gone through all elements, it returns the list `l`, which now contains **all items** from the document in a **depth-first order** (meaning it explores as deeply as possible before moving to the next branch).\n\nIn simpler terms, it\u2019s like gathering all the items from a nested structure (like folders and files) and putting them into one big, flat list."

    "summary": "Sure! Let me break this down in simple terms:\n\n1. **Purpose**: This function, called `xpath`, is designed to search and process specific elements within an XML document using an XPath query. XPath is a language for navigating and selecting nodes in an XML document.\n\n2. **Input**: It takes an `query` as input, which is an XPath expression. This expression tells the function what elements to look for in the XML document.\n\n3. **Namespace Handling**: The function is aware of a specific XML namespace called FoLiA (represented by `http://ilk.uvt.nl/folia`). It allows you to use shortcuts like `folia:` or `f:` in your XPath query to refer to elements within this namespace.\n\n4. **Processing**: It iterates over all the elements in the XML document that match the XPath query. For each matching element, it processes the element using another function called `parsexml`.\n\n5. **Output**: Instead of returning all results at once, it uses `yield` to generate results one by one as they are found. This is useful for handling large XML documents efficiently, as it doesn't load everything into memory at once.\n\n**In a nutshell**: This function helps you search an XML document using XPath, handles a specific namespace (FoLiA), and processes each matching element one by one, returning them as they are found."
